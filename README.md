# Description of the project 
Uses a perlin noise function to create a 3d world, which is used as the background for our platformer. Once the 3d world is genereated textures are then mapped to the terrain depending on their preset height. The player for the game is a red human-like model created in blender, which can move left and right, and also jump. The player must then traverse a course of blocks placed beside the 3d terrain we created. The game features, powerups, music and a score and highscore counter. 

# Instructions for use
Press play to run the game, use WASD to controll the player, and use Q to toggle powerups
