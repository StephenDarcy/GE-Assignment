# Perlin Noise Platformer Game
Name: Stephen Darcy

Student Number: C18490924

Class Group: DT211C/TU857

# Description of the project 
Uses a perlin noise function to create a 3d world, which is used as the background for our platformer. Once the 3d world is genereated textures are then mapped to the terrain depending on their preset height. The player for the game is a red human-like model created in blender, which can move left and right, and also jump. The player must then traverse a course of blocks placed beside the 3d terrain we created. The game features, powerups, music and a score and highscore counter. 

# Instructions for use
Press play to run the game, use WASD to control the player, and use Q to toggle powerups

# Blender
3D Model was created using Blender. This was my first time using Blender so it is not amazing.  
I used this video to learn how to model in Blender - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xAumJRKV6A]()

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
Overall I am proud of my whole assignment as I feel all the components worked how I wanted to them in the end, and the procedurally generated background using Perlin Noise looks good for the game. One key moment I was proud of was when I got the textures to successfully map to the terrain at certain heights as it made the game look way better.

# Proposal submitted 
Platformer style game in a 3d world. Background terrain that is procedurally generated using Perlin noise functions. A simple 3d character created in blender the user can control.
